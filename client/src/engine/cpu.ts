/**
 * HOW A COMPUTER TEAM PICKS
 *
 * Every available player gets a score in units of draft picks, and the lowest
 * score wins the pick. Starting from ADP and staying in pick units keeps every
 * dial readable: a setting that moves a player by twelve means twelve real
 * picks.
 *
 *   score = biased ADP + a random draw - the roster need bonus + a late
 *           position penalty
 *
 * Position bias moves a player by a share of their ADP plus a flat shift. The
 * share is what makes the dial behave the same at the top and the bottom of the
 * board: pushing running backs up by forty per cent moves the back at pick 60
 * to pick 33 and the back at pick 10 to pick 3. That is what "weigh running
 * backs more heavily" has to mean to stay useful in both places.
 *
 * The random draw is scaled by the standard deviation of the player's real ADP,
 * so the uncertainty sits where real drafts put it. At the default setting of 3
 * the simulator reaches exactly as far as the market does.
