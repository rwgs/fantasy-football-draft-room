 * What this pick buys you over the next one, position by position.
 *
 * The survival bar next to a player answers "will he last". This answers the
 * question you actually have on the clock, which is whether that matters. A
 * back with a 20 per cent chance of lasting is a crisis when the next back is
 * forty points worse and a shrug when the next one is three points worse, and
 * only the second number tells the two apart.
 *
 * The bars are scaled against the costliest position rather than a fixed span,
 * because the interesting reading is which position to spend on, and late in a
 * draft every real number is small.
