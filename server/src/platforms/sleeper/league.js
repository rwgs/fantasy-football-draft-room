// Read a real Sleeper league and turn it into draft settings.
//
// Sleeper publishes a league and its draft without a key, so setting the
// simulator to match a league you actually play in is a league ID and nothing
// else. Two endpoints carry everything that matters:
//
//   /v1/league/<id>   the roster shape and the scoring rules
//   /v1/draft/<id>    the order, the number of rounds and the reversal round
//
// Anything the simulator cannot model is reported as a warning rather than
// quietly dropped. A league that imports with a wrong roster is worse than one
// that refuses to import.
