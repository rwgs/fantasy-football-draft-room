// The draft board: one row per player, built from three sources.
//
// WHICH ADP WINS
// Sleeper is the primary ADP. It covers roughly 530 players against Fantasy
// Football Calculator's 230, so a deep roster still has a real board in the
// last rounds instead of a tail of unranked names. Fantasy Football Calculator
// fills the gaps, and it supplies two things Sleeper does not publish at all:
// a standard deviation for every pick, and a separate ADP per league size.
//
// The caller picks the rule with `adpSource`:
//   sleeper  Sleeper first, Fantasy Football Calculator where Sleeper is blank.
//   ffc      Fantasy Football Calculator first, Sleeper where it is blank.
//   blend    The mean of the two, over whichever of them named a pick.
//   consensus The mean of all three, ESPN's published rank included.
//
// HOW THEY JOIN
// Name plus position, with team defences on the team abbreviation. See names.js
// for why. The match rate is reported on every response, because a join that
// fails silently would just hand the simulator a shorter board.

/**
 * THE CONSENSUS BOARD, AND WHY IT IS AVERAGED IN PICKS
 *
 * Three sources, one number each, averaged over the ones that cover a player.
 *
 *   Sleeper   ADP, measured over Sleeper drafts
 *   FFC       ADP, measured over its own drafts
 *   ESPN      its published draft rank, which is an editorial opinion
 *
 * Sleeper and FFC measure the same thing over different populations. ESPN's
 * rank is the only one here that is a judgement rather than a measurement, so
 * it is the one that can disagree with the market for a reason, and the gap
 * between it and the other two is the part worth looking at.
 *
 * ESPN publishes an ADP of its own as well. It is carried for display and
 * deliberately left out of the average: counting it would give ESPN two votes
 * out of four and make a consensus of three sources mostly a report on one.
 *
 * The average is taken in picks, and ESPN's rank has to be converted before it
 * can join one. A RANK IS NOT A PICK NUMBER. ESPN ranks about twelve hundred
 * players; a twelve team draft of fifteen rounds makes a hundred and eighty
 * picks. Averaged raw, the two scales disagree worst exactly where the board
 * is thinnest: Seattle's defence reads 113 on Sleeper, 85 on FFC and 242 on
 * ESPN, and nothing about that 242 is an opinion that the defence is bad. It
 * is a rank over a longer list.
 *
 * So ESPN's ranks are mapped onto the market's own scale by position: the
 * player ESPN ranks nth of the ones on this board takes the ADP of the nth
 * player by ADP. The ordering ESPN chose is untouched — a player it likes more
 * than the market still reads earlier — and only the units change. What is left
 * after that is disagreement worth reading.
 *
 * KICKERS AND DEFENCES ARE LEFT TO THE MARKET. ESPN's ranks put them below
 * hundreds of skill players, which is not a view about Seattle's defence: it is
 * the convention that you draft those two positions last, and every ranking
 * desk that follows it produces the same shape. After the rescale above they
 * still sit about 130 picks from where the market actually takes them, against
 * 80 for the board as a whole, so ESPN abstains on those two and the market
 * decides. It matters for more than accuracy: the disagreement flag exists to
 * point at a handful of players worth a second look, and thirty two defences
 * flagged at once would bury every real one.
 *
 * Where a source does not cover a player at all it does not vote, and how many
 * did is reported per player rather than hidden, because a consensus of one is
 * not a consensus.
 */
const ESPN_ABSTAINS = new Set(['K', 'DEF']);

/**
 * How deep a real draft goes, in rounds. Twenty is past the end of almost
 * every redraft league, so nothing inside a draft is silenced by it.
 *
 * Past it a number is not a pick, because no draft has one. Sleeper's board
 * runs to about pick 700, measured over its own deep and best ball drafts, and
 * Fantasy Football Calculator stops at about 230. So a player FFC puts at 142
 * and Sleeper at 700 is not a player the two disagree about by five hundred
 * picks. FFC measured a pick; Sleeper is saying nobody takes him. Averaging
 * those two produces a number neither source would recognise, and flagging it
 * as a disagreement buries the handful of real ones under the tail of the
 * board. A source that has run out of players abstains instead.
